# ChatBot

*Cell Phone Verification ChatBot. Implemented by Eduardo J. Castillo*

## Description of the ChatBot

**I created a HTML script and loaded it to business wubsite's server. Then, I linked the site to my business page on Instagram.**

**The purpose of the Bot is to interactively verify that customers are providing a mobile number that is correct and able to send and receive text messages. This could be an actual solution to delivery issues where customers provide contact mobile numbers -for coordination of last-mile deliveries- that are invalid or cannot send and receive text messages.**

## ChatBot Demo

**Below is one of my IDD fellows trying the bot on through the Instagram App**
